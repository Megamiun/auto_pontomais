# Auto Pontomais

Script to automatize clocking in and out of the online system `Pontomais` on startup and shutdown of the computer, as well as on script call.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

First you need to have Python 3 and pip3 installed in your computer. On Debian based systems, you can use the following commands to do that:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install python3 python3-pip
```

On distros that don't have support for apt-get, I welcome you to make a pull request with an explanation for your distro.

Once done that, you can update the requirements using the following command on the root of this project:

`sudo pip install -r requirements.txt`
